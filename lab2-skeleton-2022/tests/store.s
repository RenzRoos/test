# Example of how to write tests for store instructions. In order to
# execute a store instruction, a writable memory must be available.
# To do so, we allocate a memory in the assembly program ("stack" in
# this case). After assembling the program, the memory location of the
# array must be determined. This can be done using "objdump". In this
# case, the location is 0x11100 (69888 decimal). We initialize the "sp"
# (R1) register with the value 69888+4096=73984. This way, the store
# instruction in the program below will write to a valid memory address.

       .bss
       .align 8
       .local  stack
       .comm   stack,4096,8
       .size   stack,4096
       .text
       .align 4
       .globl  _start
       .type   _start, @function
_start:
       l.addi  sp,sp,-32
       l.sw    24(sp),r6
       .word  0x40ffccff
       .size   _start, .-_start
